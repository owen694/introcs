external is making a separate css file and
saving it as style.css in the same directory you can link the
two pages together <link rel="stylesheet" href=style.css>
selectors are given to styles in internal and external style sheets
selector {properties;}
px are pixels em are for font pt is for points and % percentages
for zero unit does not need to be specified
hex nums are prefaced by # you can also use name colors built into css as well as rgb 3 val
class and id selectors
class is represented by #
id is <div id="">
id can be used to identify one element but class can do more than one
you can also apply selectors by stating the selector first
like p.jam{properties} only applies to paragraphs w class jam
